👋 Hi, I’m Adeniyi

**🧪 QA Engineer | Manual & Automation Testing | Risk-Focused**

I specialize in testing complex systems where reliability, compliance, and real-world edge cases matter. I've worked on globally used platforms, including mobile apps and enterprise tools, delivering high-quality software through test planning, automation, and proactive bug detection.

🔍 I approach testing by asking:
➤ What does it cost if this bug escapes?
⁣➤ What’s the risk if compliance fails?⁣
➤ What’s the impact of a delayed release, a recall, or a security gap?⁣

These questions guide my work and ensure quality isn't an afterthought — it’s built in from the start.
