üîç Manual Testing | Automation Testing | AI Testing | Risk-Focused QA

I specialize in both manual and automation testing, with a focus on mitigating risk. I test simple and complex systems where reliability, compliance, and real-world edge cases are critical. My process is guided by one question: "What's the real-world cost if this bug escapes?"

I also have hands-on experience in testing modern AI systems, including LLMs, RAG, and agentic AI, and a strong passion for improving the overall user experience
